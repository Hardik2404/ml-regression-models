# 📊 ML Regression Models

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project showcases various **regression models** built using Python and Jupyter Notebooks as part of my hands-on learning in machine learning.

It includes step-by-step implementations of:

* ✅ Simple Linear Regression
* ✅ Multiple Linear Regression
* ✅ Polynomial Regression

Each model uses a real-world dataset, includes preprocessing, training, prediction, and clear visualizations to better understand how regression works.

## 🔍 Regression Models Included

### 1️⃣ Simple Linear Regression

📁 `simple_linear_regression/Simple_linear_regression.ipynb`
📊 Dataset: `Salary_Data.csv`

* Predicts **salary** based on **years of experience**.
* Fits a straight line to understand linear relationships.

---

### 2️⃣ Multiple Linear Regression

📁 `multiple_linear_regression/Multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`
📊 Dataset: `50_Startups.csv`

* Predicts **startup profit** using features like:

  * R\&D Spend
  * Administration
  * Marketing Spend
  * State (with encoding)
* Demonstrates how to handle multiple variables and categorical data.

---

### 3️⃣ Polynomial Regression

📁 `polynomial_regression/Polynomial_regression.ipynb`
📊 Dataset: `Position_Salaries.csv`

* Predicts **salary** based on **position level**.
* Captures non-linear relationships by extending linear regression with polynomial features.

---

## 📂 Datasets Used

* `simple_linear_regression/Salary_Data.csv`
* `multiple_linear_regression/50_Startups.csv`
* `polynomial_regression/Position_Salaries.csv`

Each dataset is cleaned and used within its respective notebook.
